  Look in here for detailed documentation of this application

  Products used to build this application
   * elixir 1.11.3 (OTP 23) - trying to be up to date
   * phoenix 1.5.7 - again, going with the latest here
   * pow 1.0.22 - used for user authentication, registration
   * ecto_psql_extras 0.6.4 - to fulfill my live dashboard curiosity
   * ex_doc 0.23.0 - to create this documentation

  I chose pow after a a bit of a web search and appreciated the
  simplicity of adding it to an html serving app. Not so sure it
  is the best choice for an api app. But, yet to do the research.

  I regret choosing a decimal column for the widget prices and user
  credit. Float would have been much easier to deal with throughout
  the code imho.

  To run the application, see the instructions in the README.md file.

  Thank you.
